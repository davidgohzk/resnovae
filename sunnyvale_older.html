            Once upon a time in a quiet village, there lived a lively and
            curious girl named Daisy. Recently, Daisy had experienced the loss
            of her cherished companion, Elise, leaving her heart heavy with
            sorrow.
            <br /><br />
            “Elise was a radiant golden retriever adorned with silky fur. She
            was my constant source of joy and comfort. I longed dearly for the
            opportunity to relive those precious moments with my beloved Elise
            once more.”

            forest. Legend had it that this crystal possessed the power to make
            one wish come true.” the animals said.

Among all the creatures that have sought my power, you have proved yourself to be the most worthy! Since you have made a wish not for yourself but for the good of others, I will grant you the strength needed to uncover the mysteries of my forest. No foe will stand in your way as you will have the power of the very forest itself in your hands. There is a curse that separates this realm from the human realm.
